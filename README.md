# SampleProgressBar

Progress bars generally are used for displaying the status of any task, whether in execution, started, or just finished. These progress bars can be implemented using UIProgressView interface. And Here, I’ve a created a demo on [How To Add Custom Progress Bar To Represent The Status of Any Running Task in iOS App](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/custom-progress-bar-iphone-app-development/). 

If you face any issue implementing it, you can contact me for help. Also, if you want to implement this feature in your iOS App and looking to [Hire iPhone App Development Company](https://www.spaceotechnologies.com/iphone-app-development/ ) to help you, then you can contact Space-O Technologies for the same.
